Finding the right centre gives you the peace of mind, that your child is growing, learning, building lifelong skills and having fun.</p>

                                <p>Today, children are growing up in a technology-rich environment. By the time your child advances to higher learning, sitting at a desk copying figures from the board is not playing into their strengths as a student. Interactive learning is a more hands-on real world process of relaying information in classrooms. Passive learning relies on listening to the teacher or rote memorization of information. However, with interactive learning children are invited to participate in the conversation through technology or through role playing activities in class. The A 2 Zed Learning Centre has turned to interactive learning as a means of inspiring students and keeping the teacher-child relationship vital.</p>

                                <p>At the A 2 Zed Learning Centre, we offer a variety of interactive learning solutions for your child. These include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>

                                        Boxlight Technologies</li>
                                    <li>

                                        Communication with parents through RENWEB SMS</li>
                                    <li>

                                        Learning Management Systems</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>

                                    At the A 2 Zed Learning Centre we put the “tech” into technology. We are the place where “tech” rules.</p>


                                <h2 id="music">Music, Arts and Languages</h2>
                                <p>Subjects such as music, the arts and an exposure to foreign languages are beneficial to your child’s learning and development. Art develops the mind and teaches children valuable skills. Students who participate in art activities learn to think creatively and solve problems by imagining various solutions. Concentration, strong recall skills, evolved communication skills and being a good team player are just a few of the benefits research shows music and an exposure to foreign languages has on the developing mind.</p>

                                        Ballet develops the coordination of mind and body. It can improve and correct poor posture and can help to strengthen a child who is physically weak.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        Ballet builds confidence and promotes self-discipline.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        It also gives children a sense of movement, rhythm and an appreciation of music.</li>
